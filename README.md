I'm Ahmed Aboelyazeed a computer engineering undergraduate. I'm so excited about mobile development especially on Android!
I really like developing bots (specifically messenger bots 😁) that's why I have a couple of repos with weird names as bots  😂
- 🔭 I’m currently working on sharpening my skills as a software engineer.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything written in kotlin!
